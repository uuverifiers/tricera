/* PostconditionSimplifier.scala

 * See PostconditionSimplifier in "Automated Inference of ACSL Contracts for 
 * Programs with Heaps" by Oskar SÃ¶derberg
 *
 * In this contract processor, attempts are made to simplify the postcondition by 
 * using the information in the precondition. This is done as the simplified 
 * postcondition may contain more clauses that are directly expressible in ACSL. 
 * The precondition is left unchanged.
